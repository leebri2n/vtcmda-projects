This is a school project for CMDA3654, Introductory Data Analytics and Visualization. Therefore, all code is omitted so as to uphold academic integrity. Only the final result is shown.

This is the final project for CMDA3654. In R, the project consists of two data analyses: one on quantitative data, from an energy efficiency dataset on building shapes, and one on categorical data from the infamous MNIST dataset.

For the MNIST data analysis in particular, I employ multiple techniques to visualize and analyze the MNIST dataset and reports on the findings. These methods include dimension reduction by Principal Component Analysis and further t-SNE embedding, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Shrinkage Regression, and the construction of a Convolutional Neural Network.

Through this project, I had my first experiences with analysis methods associated with predicting outcomes of categorical data, which was extraordinarily fascinating. My favorite part was learning how the Convolutional Neural Network is built and tweaked. Although unfamiliar with the math involved with this neural network's backpropogation, I enjoyed contemplating the balance between creating and accurate model and overfitting it.
